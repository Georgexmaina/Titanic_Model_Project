# Titanic_Model_Project

A model build of the Titanic ship accident data to predict the survived in the accident.
I used both logistic regression and RTC models to predict the outcome.(Logistic with an accuracy of 85% after hypertuning and Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of 88% after hypertuning)
